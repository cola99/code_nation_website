        <h1>3.1 - Benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems</h1>
        <p>I believe the benefits of using I.T systems is that it can do absolutely anything you want it to do. I can't think of any draw backs because I think that depends on the person and the task, different people find different things difficult, etc. I think I could of been more efficient if I made less pages and didn't spend time on the design that much. If I were to do it in teams, I would probably assign different roles such as, 1 person does the design and graphics of the website, person 2 could be doing the css, persno 1 could be writing the html and configuring github, etc.</p><br>

        <h1>3.2 - Ways to improve productivity and efciency</h1>
        <p>I would improve efficiency and productivity by limit my tasks and take the most logical route when writing code, I would not bother with making it look nice and just start off bare-bones. When I made the website I did the design along the html in real time, I think that cost me quite a lot of time and if I were to go back and re-do everything I would: Take regular breaks so I dont feel burned out fast, track and limit how much time I'm spending on tasks, also Minimize interruptions as much as possible because I found myself easily distracted.</p><br>

        <h1>3.3 - Solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h1>
        <p>My solution would be to use a website builder, it would save HOURS of manual labour, there is nothing wrong with using one and it can be more accurate and write better code than a human but then again it would do very easy mistakes and sometimes not understand what you want to fully do. I would also like to use premade templates that exist and are free to use, they can save a giant amount of time because some of them already look the way you want them to. I also dont believe I need to use Trello or Slack if only for purposes of backups then yes but otherwise I do not need them for a small project like this but for a big project then yes.</p><br>
        
        <h1>3.4 - How you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
        <p>For e.g. Although it is standard behaviour for the user to utilise the browser which is installed with the device, sometimes users will install different software to browse with which could cause some problems of the design not showing the right content or stuff being all over the place. Often, during development of a website, error messages, pop ups and pop outs (where a new tab is created within the browser) are used. Also  development of these for different browsers and screen sizes can sometimes be missed and often bears fruit when testing.</p><br>
