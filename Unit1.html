        <h1>1.0 - About me</h1>
        <p>I came to Code Nation in hopes of starting my career in I.T.
        I have been passionate about Computers ever since the first time I held a computer mouse in my hand, and especially interested in the security aspect of computers. And it is what I would like to do for a living as well as it being something I am good at.
        I really like Code Nation so far because it feels very professional and gives me hope that one day I can land my dream job.</p><br>

        <h1>1.1 - The purpose of I.T in modern business</h1>
        <p>I.T plays a huge role in a modern business by allowing the companies to be able to contact their customers, be able to have a wider reach if they are trying to sell something instead of relying on a physical store. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages.

        <h1>1.2 - Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects</h1>
        <p>To make sure a digital project is successful you need to adopt proper time managment, communication skills, as well as use tools to aid you in your work. These tools can include: Dashboards, Timesheets, and reporting. Today's project managers are moving their teams and processes online to keep up with the competition and deliver at a faster pace than ever before. Using online project management, collaboration software and cloud file storage systems, work is getting done efficiently and with better results.</p><br>

        <h1>1.3 - Planning and carrying out tasks using IT</h1>
        <p>I will begin planning my website by adding tasks and notes on my Trello board, so that I can remember the layout without forgetting anything important. Firstly, I would probably plan what the website should look like or the skeleton of it, what webkits to use for the CSS as well as what text editor to use. I will also ensure all of the necessary deliverables for a project are completed and handed over on time and on budget. More recently, in businesses project managers have become responsible for making sure the project also aligns with business goals.</p><br>

        <h1>1.4 - What causes digital projects to fail and why?</h1>
        <p>Digital projects can fail because of due to a combination of many factors, sometimes a misunderstanding happens and usually just due to simple reasons stacking up like building blocks and failing to account for business processes as well as poor definition/expectations setting. 20% of projects fail before they’re out of the gate. If CIOs and executives don’t believe in the strategy, it’s unlikely the tactical execution will bring them around. IBM, for instance, was sued by Pennsylvania in 2017 for$110 million after a failed digital project.</p><br>

        <h1>1.5 - How you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>
        <p>Working on a project where the order is quality/scope/budget/deadline it’s quite different than working in a project where the order is deadline/budget/scope/quality. To choose the right technology you first have to understand the need for the job, you need to know specifically what it is that you want done, so you get better options by the process of elimination for e.g. if you want to make a phone application, use one of JavaScripts frameworks like Ionic.</p><br>

        <h1>1.6 - How my chosen technologies have helped me</h1>
        <p>Trello for e.g. has helped me to make sure that I stay on track and not forget important things, I have seen a boost in time managment, it's a very easy to use and useful tool. Github has helped me with sharing my code with others which resulted in people contributing something of their own and vice versa, it's a really good tool that many businesses use and people attach to their portfolios.</p><br>

        <h1>1.7 - How GDPR impacts digital projects</h1>
        <p>Naturally, the more personal data is used in conducting marketing activities, the more challenging it becomes for organisations to ensure compliance. Data gathering and profiling – Collecting information relating to customer interaction, with the objective of analysing the market and creating unique customer profiles. Additional processing to keep track of the customer choices with a view of improving the product offer based on the specific needs.

        Targeting – Reaching out to the individuals by communicating the product offer. This can take the form of one-to-one electronic communications (e.g. email, SMS, other push notification or instant messaging) or even targeting based on specific profile groups or segments. the GDPR enforces an "opt in" and "opt out" policy where all the data that is collected on you can be requested and you need to provide consent in order to be sent communications or marketing.</p><br>
