        <h1>2.1 - The ongoing use of IT tools and change approach</h1>
        <p>I have used Sublime Text Editor 3 as my coding tool because it is sort of simple and does the job well, I also really like the colours of it. Trello has been helpful too because it helps me remember which parts I still need to fill in. Overall I am very happy with the tools I used because I know them already and that saves me time, they also are really easy to work with and Sublime Text 3 can even be customised however you like it.</p><br>

        <h1>2.2 - Were the IT tools selected appropriate?</h1>
        <p>Yes I believe the tools I used were appropriate but I haven't really used Trello as much as I neede towards the end because I could remember all the tasks I had left, Sublime Text Editor 3 has been extremely useful to me and it's features saving me a lot of time.</p><br>

        <h1>2.3 - Strengths and weaknesses of final project</h1>
        <p>I think my strengths are that it looks solid and there are no weird elements that seem out of place, I think if I were to re-do it again I would pick a better and more lively theme because I was gonig for a minimalistic/simplistic scheme, I just think It would look cooler.</p><br>

        <h1>2.4 - Further improvements I can make to my project</h1>
        <p>I think my strengths are that it looks solid and there are no weird elements that seem out of place, I think if I were to re-do it again I would pick a better and more lively theme because I was gonig for a minimalistic/simplistic scheme, I just think It would look cooler.</p><br>

        <h1>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements</h1>
        <p>I have tried my best to make sure the criteria is met and that I have no error pages, no typos, and such things, I also made sure everything has a label and a purpose and there are no dead ends or anything like that. I tried to make sure the wesite looks nice and easy on the eyes so visitors should come first, search engines second. Be human. I used descriptive navigation instead of generic text.</p><br>
